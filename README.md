# Simply Static

## About

Simple script to serve a static site through Node.js.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies

`npm install`

2. Start it up

`node server.js path/to/static/files [port]`

**[port]** - *(optional)* Default 8080

## Intended Use

This is not intended for production use. I'm using it to view HTML that gets generated automatically for documentation. I needed something quick and easy that I could put in place.
